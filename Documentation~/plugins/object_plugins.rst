Object Plugin API
===================

Object Plugins are instantiated onto a single :class:`bpy.types.Object` and synced :sphinxsharp:type:`UnityEngine.GameObject`.

Object Plugins are always associated with a parent Global Plugin and will automatically be registered and unregistered alongside the parent.

See :doc:`index` for examples.
