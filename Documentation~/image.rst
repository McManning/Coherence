[WIP] Image Syncing
====================

TODO:
    * Creating an image to sync
    * Setup on Unity's side
    * Setup on Blender's side
    * Syncing channels

Outline:

-  Create a named texture slot in Unity, point it to an RT (or other
   texture target)
-  Create image in blender - making sure it's float with an alpha
   channel
-  Assign the texture to the slot in Blender and start painting on it
-  More advanced workflows - painting on multiple layers like
   spec/metallic/diffuse at once and material setup to support that
